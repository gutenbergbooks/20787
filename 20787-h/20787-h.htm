<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book, like the others in this Part, makes no
pretense at originality. The author has studied and
compared a considerable number of works by the best
authorities on the subject and has endeavored to adapt the
best of their contents to the use of printers&rsquo; apprentices.Every author has his own set of rules. At first sight, each
set appears inconsistent with those given by other writers.
This inconsistency, however, is generally more apparent
than real. It arises from differences in point of view,
method of approach, and system of classification.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to compile from these sources
a set of rules which would bring before the pupil a correct
and comprehensive view of the best current usage, well
illustrated by examples and accompanied by practical typographical
hints. The fact has been kept steadily in mind
that this book is intended for a certain definite class of pupils
and no pains have been spared to fit it to their needs.</p>

<p>Any treatise consisting, as this one necessarily does,
mainly of rules is practically useful only as a basis for constant
and persistent drill. It is, of course, valuable for reference,
but the emergencies of the day&rsquo;s work leave no
time for consultation. These rules must be learned, and
not only learned but assimilated so that their correct application
becomes instinctive and instantaneous. This result
can be secured only by practice. Hence the emphasis laid
on the exercises indicated in the paragraphs introductory to
the review questions.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Punctuation is a device by which we aid words
to tell their story. Words have done this at times
without such aid, and may now do so, but at constant risk
of serious misunderstanding. This can be easily seen by
reading the following lines printed as they would have been
written in an ancient manuscript.</p>

<p class="blockquot">

ESTABLISHTHISCONSTITUTIONFOR<br />
THEUNITEDSTATESOFAMERICA<br />
</p>

<p>Probably this particular passage could be read without
danger of serious misunderstanding. The two well-known
passages which follow, however, are cases where either a
simple statement may become a ridiculous travesty or a
serious arraignment may become a eulogy by punctuation.</p>


<p>Punctuate the following so as to express two very different
meanings:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lord Palmerston then entered on his head a
white hat upon his feet large but well polished
boots upon his brow a dark cloud in his hand a
faithful walking stick in his eye a menacing glare
saying nothing.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Punctuate the following in two ways: one to represent a
very bad man, and the other a very good man:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He is an old man and experienced in vice and
wickedness he is never found in opposing the
works of iniquity he takes delight in the downfall
of his neighbors he never rejoices in the prosperity
of his fellow-creatures he is always ready to assist
in destroying the peace of society he takes no
pleasure in serving the Lord he is uncommonly
diligent in sowing discord among his friends and
acquaintances he takes no pride in laboring to
promote the cause of Christianity he has not been
negligent in endeavoring to stigmatize all public
teachers he makes no effort to subdue his evil
passions he strives hard to build up satans kingdom
he lends no aid to the support of the gospel
among the heathen he contributes largely to the
devil he will never go to heaven he must go
where he will receive the just recompense of
reward.</p></div>

<p>Punctuation being intended for the sole purpose of making
the text intelligible and removing as many of the causes
of possible misunderstanding as may be, must depend in the
last resort on a correct understanding of the text. This understanding
may be obtained from the text itself, from the
context, that is, the writing as a whole, or from outside
knowledge about the matter under consideration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The prisoner said the witness was a sneak thief.</p>
<p>The prisoner, said the witness, was a sneak thief.</p>
</div>

<p>The meaning of this sentence depends entirely on the
presence or absence of the two commas.</p>


<p>Manuscript comes in to the printer hastily written by the
customer, author, or a reporter, or ticked over the telegraph
wire, and there is little or no punctuation. Probably the
context will supply the needed information and the line
may be set up correctly. If there is no way of finding out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
what the sentence means, follow copy. Insert no punctuation
marks which you are not sure are needed.</p>

<p>Punctuation as we know it is of recent invention. The
practice of the art of printing brought the necessity for a
defined and systematized use of the points which had, most
of them, long been in existence, but which had been used
largely according to the personal preferences of the scribes
or copyists. With the coming of the new methods of book
reproduction came the recognized need for standardization
and systematization.</p>

<p>The most ancient inscriptions and manuscripts are merely
strings of letters, without spacing between words or sentences
and without any points of any sort, like the example
on page 1.</p>

<p>The first mark to be used was the dot, or period. Its
original purpose was simply to furnish a resting place for
the eye and the mind and so help a little in the grouping of
the letters into words, clauses, and sentences, which the
mind had hitherto been compelled to do unaided. It was
used at the end of a sentence, at the end of a clause, to
indicate abbreviations, to separate crowded words, especially
where the sense was ambiguous (<span class="smcap lowercase">ANICEMAN</span> might
be either <span class="smcap lowercase">AN ICE MAN</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">A NICE MAN</span>), or even as an &aelig;sthetic
ornament between the letters of an inscription. In
early manuscripts the period is usually placed high (&#729;)
instead of low (.).</p>

<p>Sometimes a slanting mark (/) or a double dot (: or ..)
was used to indicate the end of an important section of the
writing or even of a sentence.</p>

<p>After a time spaces were introduced to show the grouping
of the letters and the words. At first the sentences were
separated by spaces, then the long words, and finally all
words. In some languages, as in Italian, there are still
combinations of long and short words, such as the combination
of the pronoun with the verb, as in <i>datemi</i>, give me.</p>

<p>During the manuscript period different schools of copyists
and even different individuals used different marks and
different systems of pointing. For a considerable time the
location of the dot indicated its force. Placed high (&#729;) it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
had the force of a period. Placed in a middle position (&middot;)
it had the force of a comma. Placed low (.) it had the
force of a semicolon. The rule, however, was not universally
observed. A Latin manuscript of the seventh
century has a high dot (&#729;) equivalent to a comma, a semicolon
used as at present, and a dot accompanied by another
dot or a dash to indicate the end of a sentence. A Latin
manuscript of the ninth century shows the comma and an
inverted semicolon ([;]) having a value between the semicolon
and colon. Medi&aelig;val manuscript pointing, therefore,
approximates modern forms in places, but lacks standardization
into recognized systems.</p>

<p>The spread of printing brought new needs into prominence.
The early printers used the period at the end of the
sentence, the colon, and sometimes the slanting line (/).
A reversed semicolon was used as a question mark.
Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton&rsquo;s successor in the printing
business in London, used five points in 1509. They were
the period, the semicolon, the comma, the &#8220;interrogative,&#8221;
and the parenthesis.</p>

<p>The systematization of punctuation is due mainly to the
careful and scholarly Aldus Manutius, who had opened a
printing office in Venice in 1494. The great printers of the
early day were great scholars as well. For a very long time
the chief concern of the printer was the opening of the
treasures of ancient thought to the world. They were therefore
compelled to be the students, critics, and editors of the
old manuscripts which served them as copy. They naturally
took their punctuation from the Greek grammarians,
but sometimes with changed meanings. The semicolon, for
instance, is the Greek mark of interrogation.</p>

<p>The period took its name from the Greek word
<ins class="greek" title="periodos">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;</ins>,
periodos, meaning a division of a sentence or a thought, as
we to-day speak of an orator&rsquo;s eloquent periods.</p>

<p>The colon comes from the Greek
<ins class="greek" title="k&ocirc;lon">&#954;&#8182;&#955;&#959;&#957;</ins>,
kolon, meaning a limb.</p>

<p>The comma comes from the Greek
<ins class="greek" title="komma">&#954;&#8057;&#956;&#956;&#945;</ins>,
komma, from
<ins class="greek" title="koptein">&#954;&#8057;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins>,
to cut.</p>

<p>The semicolon, of course, is the half colon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The question mark was made by writing the first and
last letters of the Latin word <i>questio</i>, a question, vertically,
<img src="images/qovero.gif" class="inlineImg" width="10" height="20" alt="q over o" title="q over o" /></p>

<p>The exclamation point was made by writing the letters
of the Latin word <i>Io</i>, joy, vertically, <img src="images/iovero.gif" class="inlineImg" width="8" height="20" alt="I over o" title="I over o" /></p>

<p>The punctuation marks now in use and treated of in this
book are as follows:</p>

<tr><td class="tdpunct">&#8220;&nbsp;&#8221;</td><td class="tdleft">quotation marks</td></tr>
</table>


<p>Other important marks used by printers, but not, strictly
speaking, marks of punctuation, are fully discussed in the
volume on <i>Abbreviations and Signs</i> (No. 37) in this series.</p>


<p>There are two systems of punctuation in use, known respectively
as the close and open systems. The close, or
stiff, system, using points wherever they can be used, is of
importance in precise composition of every sort, such as
laws, contracts, legal and ecclesiastical statements, and the
like. The open, or easy, system, omitting points wherever
they can be omitted, is used generally in the commoner
forms of composition. The tendency, sometimes pushed
too far, is toward an extremely open style of punctuation.
The general attitude of writers and printers may be summed
up by saying that you must justify the use of a punctuation
mark, particularly a comma, rather than its omission.</p>

<p>But why should the printer bother himself about punctuation
at all? Is that not the business of the author, the
editor, and the proofreader? Strictly speaking, yes, but
authors generally neglect punctuation, copy is not usually
carefully edited before going to the compositor, and proofreader&rsquo;s
corrections are expensive. It is therefore important
that the compositor should be intelligent about punctuation,
whether he works in a large or a small office.</p>

<p>The question of how far the printer may go in changing
or supplying the punctuation of copy will depend largely on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
circumstances. If the condition of the manuscript is such
as to show that the author really intended to put a fully
punctuated, correctly spelled, and properly capitalized manuscript
into the hands of the printer, he has a right to have
his wishes respected even if his ideas are not those which
prevail in the office. In such a case the compositor should
follow copy literally. If any questions are to be raised they
should be discussed by the proofreader <i>with the author</i>.
The same rule holds in the case of manuscripts edited before
being sent to the composing room. The editor has
assumed all responsibility for the accuracy of the copy. In
a great many cases the copy will come in carelessly written
and wholly unedited. In such cases the compositor should
punctuate as he goes along.</p>

<p>This is one of the tasks which subject the compositor to
the test of intelligence. Printing is not now and never will
be a purely mechanical trade. A printing office is no place
for an apprentice who can not learn to think.</p>


<p>This book contains a description of the functions of the
punctuation marks and the common rules for their use.
Rules for the use of punctuation marks are very different
from rules for the use of purely material things. They are
useless unless applied intelligently. No set of rules could
be devised which would work automatically or relieve the
compositor from the necessity of thinking. Punctuation can
never be reduced to an exact science.</p>

<p>Certain general directions should be borne in mind by
writers and printers.</p>

<p>I. Learn by heart the rules for punctuation.</p>

<p>II. Note the peculiarities of the best writers and the best
printers, especially in contemporary examples.</p>

<p>III. Pay constant attention to punctuation in everything
you write.</p>

<p>IV. Punctuate your sentence while you are writing it.</p>

<p>V. Understand what you are printing. <i>This is of supreme
importance.</i> Punctuation is an aid to understanding. You
cannot correctly punctuate anything that you do not
understand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_COMMA" id="THE_COMMA"></a>THE COMMA</h2>


<p>The comma is by far the most difficult of all the punctuation
marks to use correctly. Usage varies greatly
from time to time and among equally good writers and
printers at the same time. Certain general rules may be
stated and should be learned. Many cases, however, will
arise in which the rules will be differently interpreted and
differently applied by different people.</p>

<p>The comma is the least degree of separation possible of
indication in print. Its business is to define the particles and
minor clauses of a sentence. A progressive tendency may
be seen in the printing of English for centuries toward the
elimination of commas, and the substitution of the comma
for the semicolon and of the semicolon for the colon.
Compare a page of the King James version of the Bible,
especially in one of its earlier printings, with a page of
serious discourse of to-day and the effects of the tendency
will be easily seen. It is part of the general tendency toward
greater simplicity of expression which has developed the
clear and simple English of the best contemporary writers
out of the involved and ornate style of the period of Queen
Elizabeth. An ornate and involved style needs a good deal
of punctuation to make it intelligible, while a simple and
direct style needs but very little help.</p>

<p>This progressive change in the need for punctuation
and in the attitude of writers toward it accounts for the
difference in usage and for the difficulty in fixing rules to
cover all cases. The present attitude toward punctuation,
especially the use of the comma, is one of aversion. The
writer is always held to justification of the presence of a
comma rather than of its absence. Nevertheless it is quite
possible to go too far in the omission of commas in ordinary
writing. It is quite possible to construct sentences in
such a way as to avoid their use. The result is a harsh and
awkward style, unwarranted by any necessity. Ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
writing needs some use of commas to indicate the sense
and to prevent ambiguity.</p>

<p>Always remember that the real business of the comma
is just that of helping the meaning of the words and of
preventing ambiguity by showing clearly the separation
and connection of words and phrases. If there is possibility
of misunderstanding without a comma, put one in.
If the words tell their story beyond possibility of misunderstanding
without a comma, there is no reason for its
use. This rule will serve as a fairly dependable guide in
the absence of any well recognized rule for a particular
case, or where doubt exists as to the application of a rule.</p>


<p>Reversed, and usually in pairs, commas mark the beginning
of a quotation.</p>

<p>In numerical statements the comma separates Arabic
figures by triplets in classes of hundreds: $5,276,492.72.</p>

<p>In tabular work reversed commas are used as a sign for
ditto.</p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="ditto">

<p>The comma is placed between the words which it is
intended to separate. When used in connection with
quotation marks, it is always placed inside them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He was tall, thin, and dark.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The comma may be omitted when the words are combined
into a single idea.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A still hot day.</p>
<p>An old black coat.</p>
</div>

<p>2. After each pair in a series of pairs of words or phrases
not connected by conjunctions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish,</p>
<p>I give my hand and my heart to this vote.</p>
<p>Formerly the master printer, his journeymen,</p>
<p>even his apprentices, all lived in the same house.</p>
</div>

<p>3. To separate contrasted words.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We rule by love, not by force.</p></div>

<p>4. Between two independent clauses connected by a
conjunction.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The press was out of order, but we managed to
start it.</p></div>

<p>5. Before a conjunction when the word which preceded
it is qualified by an expression which does not qualify the
word which follows the conjunction.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He quickly looked up, and spoke.</p></div>

<p>6. Between relative clauses which explain the antecedent,
or which introduce a new thought.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The type, which was badly worn, was not fit for
the job.</p></div>

<p>If the relative clause limits the meaning of the antecedent,
but does not explain it and does not add a new
thought, the comma is not used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He did only that which he was told to do.</p></div>

<p>7. To separate parenthetical or intermediate expressions
from the context.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The school, you may be glad to know, is very
successful.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The books, which I have read, are returned
with gratitude.</p>
<p>He was pleased, I suppose, with his work.</p>
</div>

<p>If the connection of such expressions is so close as to
form one connected idea the comma is not used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The press nearest the south window is out of order.</p></div>

<p>If the connection of such expressions is remote, parentheses
are used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Committee (appointed under vote of April
10, 1909) organized and proceeded with business.</p></div>

<p>8. To separate the co-ordinate clauses of compound
sentences if such clauses are simple in construction and
closely related.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He was kind, not indulgent, to his men; firm,
but just, in discipline; courteous, but not familiar,
to all.</p></div>

<p>9. To separate quotations, or similar brief expressions
from the preceding part of the sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>C&aelig;sar reported to the Senate, &#8220;I came, I saw, I conquered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question is, What shall we do next?</p>
</div>

<p>10. To indicate the omission of the verb in compound
sentences having a common verb in several clauses.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One man glories in his strength, another in his
wealth, another in his learning.</p></div>

<p>11. To separate phrases containing the case absolute
from the rest of the sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The form having been locked up, a proof was
taken.</p></div>

<p>12. Between words or phrases in apposition to each
other.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I refer to DeVinne, the great authority on Printing.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The comma is omitted when such an apposition is used
as a single phrase or a compound name.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The poet Longfellow was born in Portland.</p>
<p>The word <i>patriotic</i> is now in extensive use.</p>
</div>

<p>13. After phrases and clauses which are placed at the
beginning of a sentence by inversion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Worn out by hard wear, the type at last became unfit for use.</p>
<p>Ever since, he has been fond of celery.</p>
</div>

<p>The comma is omitted if the phrase thus used is very
short.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of success there could be no doubt.</p></div>

<p>14. Introductory phrases beginning with <i>if</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>wherever</i>,
<i>whenever</i>, and the like should generally be separated
from the rest of the sentence by a comma, even when the
statement may appear to be direct.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When a plain query has not been answered, it is best to follow copy.</p>
<p>If the copy is hard to read, the compositor will set but few pages.</p>
</div>

<p>15. To separate introductory words and phrases and
independent adverbs from the rest of the sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, what are you going to do there?</p>

<p>I think, also, Franklin owed much of his success to his strong common sense.</p>

<p>This idea, however, had already been grasped by others.</p></div>

<p>Of course the comma is not used when these adverbs
are used in the ordinary way.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They also serve who only stand and wait.</p>
<p>This must be done, however contrary to our inclinations.</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>16. To separate words or phrases of direct address from
the context.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I submit, gentlemen, to your judgment.</p>
<p>From today, my son, your future is in your own hands.</p>
</div>

<p>17. Between the name of a person and his title or

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States.</p>
<p>Charles W. Eliot, LL.D.</p>
</div>

<p>18. Before the word <i>of</i> connecting a proper name with
residence or position.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Elihu B. Root, Senator from New York.</p>
</div>

<p>19. After the salutatory phrase at the beginning of a
letter, when informal.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear John,</p></div>

<p>When the salutation is formal a colon should be used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My dear Mr. Smith:</p></div>

<p>20. To separate the closing salutation of a formal letter
from the rest of the sentence of which it forms a part.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Soliciting your continued patronage, I am,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Very sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">John W. Smith.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>21. To separate two numbers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>January 31, 1915.</p>
<p>By the end of 1914, 7062 had been built.</p>
</div>

<p>22. To indicate an ellipsis.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Subscription for the course, one dollar.</p></div>

<p>Exceptions to this rule are made in very brief sentences,
especially in advertisements: Tickets 25 cents.
Price one dollar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The foregoing rules for the use of the comma have
been compiled from those given by a considerable number
of authorities. Further examination of authorities would
probably have added to the number and to the complexity
of these rules. No two sets of rules which have come
under the writer&rsquo;s observation are alike. Positive disagreements
in modern treatises on the subject are few. The
whole matter, however, turns so much on the use made
of certain general principles and the field is so vast that
different writers vary greatly in their statements and even in
their ideas of what ought to be stated. It is very difficult to
strike the right mean between a set of rules too fragmentary
and too incomplete for any real guidance and a set of
rules too long to be remembered and used.</p>

<p>After all possible has been done to indicate the best
usage it remains true that the writer or the printer must, in
the last resort, depend very largely on himself for the proper
application of certain principles. The compositor may find
himself helped, or restricted, by the established style of the
office, or he may at times be held to strict following of
copy. When left to himself he must be guided by the
following general principles:</p>

<p>I. The comma is used to separate for the eye what is
separate in thought.</p>

<p>The comma is not intended to break the matter up into
lengths suited to the breath of one reading aloud.</p>

<p>The comma is not an &aelig;sthetic device to improve the
appearance of the line.</p>

<p>II. The sole purpose of the comma is the unfolding of
the sense of the words.</p>

<p>III. The comma cannot be correctly used without a
thorough understanding of the sense of the words.</p>

<p>IV. In case of doubt, omit the comma.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_SEMICOLON" id="THE_SEMICOLON"></a>THE SEMICOLON</h2>


<p>The semicolon is used to denote a degree of separation
greater than that indicated by the comma, but less
than that indicated by the colon. It prevents the repetition
of the comma and keeps apart the more important members
of the sentence. The semicolon is generally used in
long sentences, but may sometimes be properly used in
short ones.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Semicolon</p>

<p>1. When the members of a compound sentence are
complex or contain commas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Franklin, like many others, was a printer; but,
unlike the others, he was student, statesman, and
publicist as well.</p>

<p>With ten per cent of this flour the bread acquired
a slight flavor of rye; fifteen per cent gave it a
dark color; a further addition made the baked
crumb very hard.</p>

<p>The meeting was composed of representatives
from the following districts: Newton, 4 delegates,
2 substitutes; Dorchester, 6 delegates, 3
substitutes; Quincy, 8 delegates, 4 substitutes;
Brookline, 10 delegates, 5 substitutes.</p></div>

<p>2. When the members of a compound sentence contain
statements distinct, but not sufficiently distinct to be thrown
into separate sentences.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sit thou a patient looker-on;</p>
<p>Judge not the play before the play be done;</p>
<p>Her plot has many changes; every day</p>
<p>Speaks a new scene. The last act crowns the play.</p>
</div>

<p>3. When each of the members of a compound sentence
makes a distinct statement and has some dependence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
on statements in the other member or members of the
sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wisdom hath builded her house; she hath hewn
out her seven pillars; she hath killed her beasts;
she hath mingled her wine; she hath furnished
her table.</p></div>

<p>Each member of this sentence is nearly complete. It is
not quite a full and definite statement, but it is much more
than a mere amplification such as we might get by leaving
out <i>she hath</i> every time after the first. In the former
case we should use periods. In the latter we should use
commas.</p>

<p>4. A comma is ordinarily used between the clauses of a
compound sentence that are connected by a simple conjunction,
but a semicolon may be used between clauses
connected by conjunctive adverbs. Compare the following
examples:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The play was neither edifying nor interesting to
him, and he decided to change his plans.</p>

<p>The play was neither edifying nor interesting to
him; therefore he decided to change his plans.</p></div>

<p>5. To indicate the chapter references in scriptural
citations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Matt. i: 5, 7, 9; v: 1-10; xiv: 3, 8, 27.</p></div>

<p>The semicolon should always be put outside quotation
marks unless it forms a part of the quotation itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Take care of the cents and the dollars will take
care of themselves&#8221;; a very wise old saying.</p></div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_COLON" id="THE_COLON"></a>THE COLON</h2>


<p>The colon marks the place of transition in a long sentence
consisting of many members and involving a
logical turn of the thought. Both the colon and semicolon
are much less used now than formerly. The present
tendency is toward short, simple, clear sentences, with
consequent little punctuation, and that of the open style.
Such sentences need little or no aid to tell their story.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Colon</p>

<p>1. Before <i>as</i>, <i>viz.</i>, <i>that is</i>, <i>namely</i>, etc., when these words
introduce a series of particular terms in apposition with a
general term.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The American flag has three colors: namely, red,
white, and blue.</p></div>

<p>2. Between two members of a sentence when one or
both are made up of two or more clauses divided by semicolons.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Englishman was calm and self-possessed;
his antagonist impulsive and self-confident: the
Englishman was the product of a volunteer army
of professional soldiers; his antagonist was the
product of a drafted army of unwilling conscripts.</p></div>

<p>3. Before particular elements in a definite statement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bad: He asked what caused the accident?<br />
Right: He asked, &#8220;What caused the accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>Napoleon said to his army at the battle of the
Pyramids: &#8220;Soldiers, forty centuries are looking
down upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duties of the superintendent are grouped
under three heads: first, etc.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
4. Before formal quotations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Write a short essay on the following topic:
&#8220;What is wrong with our industrial system?&#8221;</p></div>

<p>When the formal introduction is brief, a comma may
be used.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>St. Paul said, &#8220;Bear ye one another&rsquo;s burdens.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>5. After the formal salutatory phrase at the opening of a
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My dear Sir:</p></div>

<p>When the letter is informal use a comma.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear John,</p></div>

<p>6. Between the chapter and verse in scriptural references.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John xix: 22.</p></div>

<p>7. Between the city of publication and the name of the
publisher in literary references.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Practice of Typography.&#8221; New York:
Oswald Publishing Company.</p></div>

<p>The colon has been similarly employed in the imprints
on the title pages of books.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880.</p></div>

<p>DeVinne remarks upon this use of the colon that it is
traditional and can not be explained.</p>


<p>The colon is sometimes used between the hours and
minutes in indicating time, like: 11:42 a.m.</p>


<p>DeVinne does not approve of this, though other authorities
give it as the rule. It is probably better to use the
period in spite of its use as a decimal point, which use was
probably the motive for seeking something else to use in
writing time indications. In railroad printing the hour is
often separated from the minutes by a simple space without
any punctuation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_PERIOD" id="THE_PERIOD"></a>THE PERIOD</h2>


<p>The period, or full stop, marks the end of a declarative
sentence. As a sign it has several other uses which
will appear in the paragraphs following.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Period</p>

<p>1. At the end of every sentence unless interrogative or
exclamatory.</p>

<p>2. After abbreviations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nicknames, <i>Sam</i>, <i>Tom</i>, etc., are not regarded as abbreviations.</p>

<p>The metric symbols are treated as abbreviations but
the chemical symbols are not. M. (metre) and mg.
(milligram) but H<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;O and Na&nbsp;Cl.</p>

<p>Per cent is not regarded as an abbreviation.</p>

<p>The names of book sizes (12mo 16mo) are not regarded
as abbreviations.</p></div>

<p>The period is now generally omitted in display matter
after</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Running heads,</p>
<p>Cut-in side-notes,</p>
<p>Central head-lines,</p>
<p>Box heads in tables,</p>
<p>Signatures at the end of letters.</p>
</div>

<p>The period is omitted</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After Roman numerals, even though they have the
value of ordinals.</p>

<p>After MS and similar symbols.</p>

<p>In technical matter, after the recognized abbreviations
for linguistic epochs. IE (Indo-European), MHG
(Middle High German)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and after titles of well-known publications indicated
by initials such as AAAPS (Annals of the American
Academy of Political Science).</p></div>

<p>When a parenthesis forms the end of a declarative sentence
the period is placed outside the parenthesis, as in the
preceding example. A period is placed inside a parenthesis
only in two cases.</p>

<p>1. After an abbreviation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This was 50 years ago (i.e. 1860 A.D.)</p></div>

<p>2. At the end of an independent sentence lying entirely
within the parenthesis.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lincoln was at the height of his powers in 1860
(He was elected to the presidency at this time.)</p></div>

<p>When a sentence ends with a quotation, the period
always goes inside the quotation marks.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have just read DeVinne&rsquo;s &#8220;Practice of Typography.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The same rule applies to the use of the other low marks,
comma, semicolon, and colon, in connection with quotation
marks. Unlike most rules of grammar and punctuation,
this rule does not rest on a logical basis. It rests on purely
typographic considerations, as the arrangement of points
indicated by the rule gives a better looking line than can be
secured by any other arrangement.</p>


<p class="rules">Other Uses of the Period</p>

<p>1. The period is used as a decimal point.</p>

<p>2. The period is used in groups, separated by spaces, to
indicate an ellipsis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>He read as follows: &#8220;The gentleman said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>he was there and saw&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the act in question.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_DASH" id="THE_DASH"></a>THE DASH</h2>


<p>The dash is a very useful mark which has been greatly
overworked by careless writers. It is very easy to
make in manuscript and serves as a convenient cover for the
writer&rsquo;s ignorance of what point should properly be used.</p>

<p>The conspicuousness of the dash makes it a very useful
mark for guiding the eye of the reader to the unity of the
sentence. It is particularly useful in legal pleadings where
there is much repetition of statement and great elaboration
of detail. In such cases commas, semicolons, and even
parentheses are so multiplied that the relation of the clauses
is lost sight of. The confusion thus arising may often be
cleared up by intelligent use of the dash.</p>

<p>The dash is sometimes used to connect a side heading
with the text that follows, or to connect the end of that
text with the name of the writer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">A Rule for Peace.</span>&mdash;If it be possible, as
much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
men.&mdash;<i>St. Paul.</i></p></div>

<p>The dash is sometimes used in catalogue work as a ditto
mark.</p>

<div class="blockquotIndent">
<p><span class="smcap">De Vinne, Theodore Low</span>. Historic Printing Types. New York, 1886.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;The Invention of Printing. Francis Hart &amp; Co., New York, 1878.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;Plain Printing Types. Oswald Publishing Co., New York, 1914.</p>
</div>

<p>French printers use the dash in printing dialogue as a
partial substitute for quotation marks. Quotation marks
are placed at the beginning and end of the dialogue and a
dash precedes each speech. This form is used even if the
dialogue is extended over many pages.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Dash</p>

<p>1. To mark abrupt changes in sentiment and in construction.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Have you ever heard&mdash;but how should you hear?</p></div>

<p>2. To mark pauses and repetitions used for dramatic or
rhetorical effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They make a desert, and call it&mdash;peace.</p>
<p>Thou, great Anna, whom three states obey,</p>
<p>Who sometimes counsel takes&mdash;and sometimes tea.</p>
</div>

<p>3. To express in one sentence great contrariety of action
or emotion or to increase the speed of the discourse by a
succession of snappy phrases.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>She starts&mdash;she moves&mdash;she seems to feel</p>
<p>The thrill of life along her keel.</p>
</div>

<p>In this connection DeVinne gives the following excellent
example from Sterne:</p>

<div class="blockquot" style="width: 18.5em;"><p>Nature instantly ebbed again;&mdash;the film returned
to its place;&mdash;the pulse fluttered,&mdash;stopped,&mdash; went
on,&mdash;throbbed,&mdash;stopped again,&mdash;moved, &mdash;stopped,&mdash;Shall
I go on?&mdash;No.</p></div>

<p>Attention may be called to Sterne&rsquo;s use of the semicolon
and the comma with the dash, a use now obsolete except
in rare cases.</p>

<p>4. To separate the repetition or different amplifications
of the same statement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The infinite importance of what he has to do&mdash;the
goading conviction that it must be done&mdash;the
dreadful combination in his mind of both the
necessity and the incapacity&mdash;the despair of
crowding the concerns of an age into a moment&mdash;the
impossibility of beginning a repentance
which should have been completed&mdash;of setting
about a peace which should have been concluded&mdash;of
suing for a pardon which should have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
obtained&mdash;all these complicated concerns intolerably
augment the sufferings of the victims.</p></div>

<p>5. At the end of a series of phrases which depend upon
a concluding clause.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Railroads and steamships, factories and warehouses,
wealth and luxury&mdash;these are not civilization.</p></div>

<p>6. When a sentence is abruptly terminated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If I thought he said it I would&mdash;</p></div>

<p>7. To precede expressions which are added to an apparently
completed sentence, but which refer to some
previous part of the sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He wondered what the foreman would say&mdash;he
had a way of saying the unexpected.</p></div>

<p>8. To connect extreme dates in time indication.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The war of 1861&mdash;1865. The war of 1861-1865.</p></div>

<p>9. To define verse references in the Bible or page
references in books.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Matt. v: &nbsp; 1&mdash;11.<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Matt. v: 1-11.</span></p>
<p>See pp. 50&mdash;53.<span style="margin-left: 2em;">See pp. 50-53.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="smallFont"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> In instances such as given in the two preceding rules the
en dash may sometimes serve if the em dash appears too conspicuous.</p>

<p>10. A dash preceded by a colon is sometimes used before
a long quotation forming a new paragraph. In other
cases no point need accompany the dash.</p>

<p>The dash is sometimes used as a substitute for commas.
Writers on the subject say that this use occurs when the
connection between the parenthetical clause and the context
is closer than would be indicated by commas. The
distinction, if real, is difficult to see. It would be better if
none but the most experienced writers attempted the use
of the dash in this way.</p>

<p>Dashes are often used instead of marks of parenthesis.
It is better to let each mark do its own work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_PARENTHESIS" id="THE_PARENTHESIS"></a>THE PARENTHESIS</h2>


<p>The parenthesis, commonly used in pairs, encloses expressions
which have no essential connection with the
rest of the sentence, but are important to its full comprehension.
It is liable to be neglected by writers because the
dash is easier to make, and by printers because it is generally
thought to mar the beauty of the line. Its distinct uses,
however, should not be neglected.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Parenthesis</p>

<p>1. To introduce into a sentence matter which is not
essentially connected with the rest of the sentence, but aids
in making it clear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Trouble began when the apprentice (who had
been strictly forbidden to do so) undertook to do
some work on his own account.</p>

<p>This year (1914) saw the outbreak of a general
war.</p></div>

<p>2. In reports of speeches to enclose the name of a person
who has been referred to, or to indicate expressions on
the part of the audience.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The honorable gentleman who has just spoken
(Mr. Lodge) has no superior on this floor in his
knowledge of international law. (Applause.)</p></div>

<p>3. Parentheses enclosing interrogation points or exclamation
points are sometimes introduced into a sentence to
cast doubt on a statement or to express surprise or contempt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He said that on the fifth of January (?) he was
in New York.</p>

<p>This most excellent (!) gentleman.</p></div>

<p>4. Parentheses are used, generally in pairs, sometimes
singly, to enclose the reference letters or figures used to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mark division and classification in arguments or in precise
statements.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is done because: (a) it is clearer; (b) it is
shorter.</p></div>

<p>These signs may be printed in several ways.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned form of parenthesis, always made too
thin, may need a thin space between it and its adjoining
character when it is placed too close to any letter that
nearly fills the body in height, as in (&thinsp;Hall&thinsp;). The space
may not be needed when the proximate character has a
shoulder, as in (&thinsp;Art), or when the parenthesis follows a
period.)</p>

<p>The italic form of parenthesis is objectionable in book
work. Distinction is sought for the word in italic and not
for the parenthesis enclosing the word. The italic parenthesis
may be used in job-work or full display lines of italic
letters.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BRACKET" id="THE_BRACKET"></a>THE BRACKET</h2>


<p>Brackets are used in pairs, like the parentheses. In
Job composition either brackets or parentheses may
be used, as suits the fancy or is convenient. In descriptive
text matter, however, brackets should not be used where
parentheses are clearly indicated.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Bracket</p>

<p>1. To enclose words or phrases which are entirely independent
of the rest of the sentence.</p>

<p>The enclosed words are usually comments, queries,
corrections, criticisms, or directions inserted by some person
other than the original writer or speaker.</p>

<p>2. To enclose passages of doubtful authenticity in reprints
of early manuscripts, special amendments to bills
under legislative consideration, or any other portions of a
text which need peculiar identification.</p>

<p>3. In legal or ecclesiastical papers to indicate numerical
words which may have to be changed, or to indicate where
details are to be supplied.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is the first [<i>second or third</i>] publication.</p>

<p>The officers shall remain in office [<i>here state the
time</i>] or until their successors are duly qualified.</p></div>

<p>4. To avoid the confusion caused by a parenthesis within
a parenthesis.</p>

<p>5. A single bracket is used to enclose the ending of a
long line of poetry which will not fit the register and has to
be run over into an adjoining line.</p>

<p>Doubt whether to use parentheses or brackets can usually
be settled by this general principle:</p>

<p>Parentheses always enclose remarks apparently made by
the writer of the text. Brackets enclose remarks certainly
made by the editor or reporter of that text.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INTERROGATION" id="THE_INTERROGATION"></a>THE INTERROGATION</h2>


<p>The interrogation is the point that asks questions. It
should always be placed outside quotation marks unless
it is a part of the quotation itself.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Interrogation</p>

<p>1. The interrogation point is used at the end of every
direct question.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Are you there?</p></div>

<p>Indirect questions, that is, statements that a question has
been asked, do not require the interrogation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He asked me if I was there.</p>

<p>He asked the question, Are you there? and received
no answer.</p></div>

<p>2. At the end of each of a series of questions thrown
into a single sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Did he speak in an ordinary tone? or shout? or
whisper?</p></div>

<p>3. The interrogation, like a certain inflection in the
voice, may indicate that a sentence, though declarative in
form, is really a question and requires an answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You are, of course, familiar with New York?</p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_EXCLAMATION" id="THE_EXCLAMATION"></a>THE EXCLAMATION</h2>


<p>The exclamation mark is the mark of strong emotion.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Exclamation</p>

<p>1. After every expression of great surprise or emotion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Look, my lord! it comes!</p>
<p>Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</p>
<p>Alas! my father.</p>
</div>

<p>2. After interjections and other exclamatory words.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hurrah! Good! Away! Oh!</p></div>

<p>Where the exclamations are repeated without particularly
emphasizing each one, each may be followed by a
comma except the last.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ha, ha, ha! That&rsquo;s a good joke!</p></div>

<p>O used as a vocative or to express a desire or imprecation
does not call for an exclamation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>O John.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>O, that night would come!</p>
</div>

<p>The exclamation is sometimes used in job printing to fill
out a display line or for other inadequate reasons. These
uses should be avoided.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_APOSTROPHE" id="THE_APOSTROPHE"></a>THE APOSTROPHE</h2>


<p>The apostrophe is primarily the sign of the possessive
case, but it has several other uses.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of the Apostrophe</p>

<p>1. The apostrophe for the possessive case is added only
to nouns, not to the pronouns, which have their distinct
possessive forms. <i>Its</i> is a possessive pronoun. <i>It&rsquo;s</i> is an
abbreviation for <i>it is</i>. Do not use an apostrophe with the
possessive adjectives <i>hers</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>theirs</i>, <i>its</i>.</p>

<p>2. All nouns in the singular and all nouns in the plural
except those ending in <i>s</i> take an apostrophe and <i>s</i> to form
the possessive.</p>

<p>Nouns in the plural ending in <i>s</i> take an apostrophe only
to form the possessive.</p>

<p>There is much difference of opinion as to the invariability
of the rule concerning singular nouns in <i>s</i>. DeVinne
advises following the pronunciation. Where the second <i>s</i>
is not pronounced, as often happens, to avoid the prolonged
hissing sound of another <i>s</i>, he recommends omitting it in
print.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Moses&rsquo; hat, for Moses&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p>For conscience&rsquo; sake.</p>
</div>

<p>3. The apostrophe indicates the omission of letters in
dialect, in familiar dialogue, and in poetry.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>That&rsquo;s &rsquo;ow &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas ever thus.</p>
</div>

<p>When two words are practically made into one syllable,
a thin space may be put before the apostrophe, except that
<i>don&rsquo;t</i>, <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, <i>won&rsquo;t</i>, and <i>shan&rsquo;t</i> are consolidated. This use
of a space serves to distinguish between the possessive in <i>s</i>
and the contraction of <i>is</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Where death&thinsp;&rsquo;s abroad and sorrow&thinsp;&rsquo;s close behind.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
4. Figures expressing dates are often abbreviated, but it
is not good general practice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The boys of &rsquo;61.</p>
<p>It happened in &rsquo;14.</p>
</div>

<p>5. The apostrophe is used to form the plural of letters
and figures.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Cross your t&rsquo;s and dot your i&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Make 3&rsquo;s and 5&rsquo;s more plain.</p>
</div>

<p>Except in these cases the apostrophe is not a plural sign
and should be so used only when it is intended to reproduce
a dialect or colloquialism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Wrong: All the Collins&rsquo;s were there.</p>
<p>Right: All the Collinses were there.</p>
</div>

<p>The final <i>ed</i> of past tenses and past participles was formerly
pronounced as a distinct syllable, thus: <i>clos-ed</i>,
<i>belov-ed</i>, and this pronunciation continued in common use
in poetry long after it was discontinued in prose. During
this period of transition the modern pronunciation was indicated
by dropping the <i>e</i> and using an apostrophe, thus:
<i>clos&rsquo;d</i>, <i>belov&rsquo;d</i>. It is now understood that while the full spelling
is to be used, the old pronunciation is not to be used
unless specially indicated by placing a grave accent over the
<i>e</i> of the last syllable, thus: <i>belov&egrave;d</i>.</p>

<p>At the same period poets, especially, used an apostrophe
to indicate a silent <i>e</i> as in <i>ev&rsquo;ry</i>, but the usage is now obsolete.</p>

<p>Such abbreviations as <i>Dep&rsquo;t</i>, <i>Gov&rsquo;t</i>, <i>Sec&rsquo;y</i>, and the like,
are objectionable in print. If such abbreviations are necessary
it is better to use the forms <i>Dept.</i>, <i>Govt.</i>, <i>Secy.</i></p>

<h2><a name="THE_HYPHEN" id="THE_HYPHEN"></a>THE HYPHEN</h2>


<p>The hyphen is used to join compound words; to mark
the division of a word too long to go entirely into one
line; to separate the syllables of words in order to show
pronunciation; as a leader in tabular work. For this last
purpose the period is to be preferred to any other mark in
use. Tabular work without leaders is obscure and therefore
objectionable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="QUOTATION_MARKS" id="QUOTATION_MARKS"></a>QUOTATION MARKS</h2>


<p>Quotation marks are signs used to indicate that
the writer is giving exactly the words of another. A
French printer named Morel used a comma in the
outer margin to indicate a quoted line about 1550. About
a century later another Frenchman, M&eacute;nage, introduced a
mark (&laquo;&raquo;) resembling a double parenthesis but shorter.
These marks were cast on the middle of the type body so
that they could be reversed for use at either the beginning
or the end of a quotation. The French have retained these
signs as their quotation marks ever since.</p>

<p>When the English adopted the use of quotation marks,
they did not take over the French marks, but substituted two
inverted commas at the beginning and two apostrophes at
the end of the quoted paragraph. These marks are typographically
unsatisfactory. They are weak and therefore
hardly adequate to their purpose in aiding the understanding
through the eye. Being cast on the upper part of the type
body, they leave a blank space below and thus impair the
beauty of the line and interfere with good spacing. Certain
rules for the position of quotation marks when used with
other marks are based upon these typographical considerations
rather than upon logical considerations.</p>


<p class="rules">Rules for the Use of Quotation Marks</p>

<p>1. Every direct quotation should be enclosed in double
quotation marks.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if I can.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Reports of what another person has said when given
in words other than his own are called indirect quotations
and take no marks.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He said he would go if he could.</p></div>

<p>2. A quotation of several paragraphs requires quotation
marks at the beginning of each paragraph, but at the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the last one only. In legal documents, and sometimes
elsewhere, quotations are defined and emphasized by putting
double commas at the beginning of every line of the
quotation.</p>

<p>The same result may be better obtained by using smaller
type, or indenting the quotation, or both.</p>

<p>3. A quotation included within another quotation should
be enclosed by single quotation marks.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He said: &#8220;I heard him cry &lsquo;Put down that gun,&rsquo;
and then I heard a shot.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>4. Titles of books, essays, art works, etc., are usually
enclosed in quotation marks. When the books are supposedly
familiar to all readers, the marks are not used. You
would not print &#8220;The Bible,&#8221; &#8220;Paradise Lost,&#8221; &#8220;The Iliad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The titles of books, etc., are sometimes printed in
italics instead of being enclosed in quotation marks. This
is a matter of office style rather than of good or bad practice.</p>

<p>5. In writing about plays or books, the name of the work
may be quoted and the name of a character italicized.
This is done to avoid confusion between the play, the
character, and the real person portrayed. &#8220;William Tell&#8221;
is a play. <i>William Tell</i> is a character in fiction. William
Tell is a national hero of Switzerland.</p>

<p>This usage is by no means uniform; here again, we are
on the ground of office style.</p>

<p>6. Names of vessels are sometimes quoted, sometimes
italicized, and sometimes printed without distinguishing
marks. Here we are once more on the ground of office
style.</p>

<p>7. Sentences from a foreign language are usually enclosed
in quotation marks. Single words or phrases are usually
printed in italics. Both italics and quotation marks should
not be used except under certain unusual conditions or
when positively ordered by the author.</p>

<p>8. Quotation marks may be used with a word to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the writer desires to attract particular attention or to which
he desires to give an unusual, technical, or ironical meaning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This &#8220;gentleman&#8221; needs a shave.</p></div>

<p>9. When a quotation is long or when it is introduced in
a formal manner, it is usually preceded by a colon. Isolated
words or phrases call for no point after the introductory
clause. This is true when the phrases so quoted run
to considerable length, provided there is no break in the
flow of thought and expression.</p>

<p>10. When a quotation ends a sentence the quotation
marks are placed after the period.</p>

<p>The comma is always placed inside the quotation marks.</p>

<p>The position of the other marks (semicolon, colon, exclamation,
and interrogation) is determined by the sense.
If they form a part of the matter quoted, they go inside the
quote marks; if not, they go outside them.</p>

<p>11. When quotation marks occur at the beginning of a
line of poetry, they should go back into the indention space.</p>

<p>
&#8220;Breathes there a man with soul so dead<br />
&nbsp;Who never to himself hath said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&lsquo;This is my own, my native land&rsquo;?&#8221;</span><br />
</p>

<p>This illustration is also a good example of the use of
marks in combinations. We have first the single quotation
marking the end of the included quotation, then the interrogation
which ends the sentence, then the double quotation
marks in their proper position.</p>


<p>Quotation marks should not be used needlessly. Very
familiar expressions from the best known authors, such as
<i>to the manor born</i>, <i>a conscience void of offence</i>, <i>with malice toward
none and charity for all</i>, have become part of the
current coin of speech and need not be quoted. Lists of
words considered as words merely, lists of books or plays,
and other such copy should be printed without quotation
marks. Sprinkling a page thickly with quotation marks
not only spoils its appearance but makes it hard to read,
without adding to its clearness of meaning.</p>

<h2><a name="GENERAL_REMARKS" id="GENERAL_REMARKS"></a>GENERAL REMARKS</h2>


<p>Book titles are now set without points. This fashion
was introduced by Pickering of London about 1850.
This method is generally to the advantage of the title page
thus treated. It is possible, however, to carry it too far
and so to obscure the sense. Commas should not be omitted
from firm names, such as Longmans, Green &amp; Co.,
as in case of such omission there is no way of knowing
whether one or more persons are indicated. Punctuation
should not be omitted from the titles which may accompany
an author&rsquo;s name, nor from the date if day and month
are given as well as year.</p>

<p>Avoid the doubling of points wherever possible. When
an abbreviation precedes a colon, omit the period. When
an abbreviation precedes a comma, the period is often inserted,
but in many cases one or the other can be dropped
to advantage. The dash is not generally preceded by a
comma, semicolon, or colon in current printing usage. A
comma should rarely go before the first parenthesis. If used
at all with the parentheses, it should follow the closing
parenthesis. When a complete sentence is enclosed in
parentheses, the period falls within the parentheses. When
the enclosure is a brief passage at the end of a sentence,
the period falls outside the parentheses.</p>

<p>Do not put a period before the apostrophe and the possessive
<i>s</i> as in <i>Co.&rsquo;s</i>. The word <i>Company</i> may be abbreviated
to <i>Co.</i> although it is not desirable to do so if it can be
avoided. The possessive of <i>Co.</i> is <i>Co&rsquo;s</i>.</p>

<p>5. A dash marks abruptness or irregularity.</p>

<p>6. Parentheses enclose interpolations in the sentence.</p>

<p>7. Brackets enclose irregularities in the sentence.</p>

<p>8. An interrogation asks a question for an answer.</p>

<p>9. An exclamation marks surprise.</p>

<p>10. An apostrophe marks elisions and the possessive case.</p>

<h2><a name="REVIEW_QUESTIONS" id="REVIEW_QUESTIONS"></a>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2>


<h3>SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS</h3>

<div style="font-size: 90%;">
<p>The following questions, based on the contents of this pamphlet, are
intended to serve (1) as a guide to the study of the text, (2) as an aid
to the student in putting the information contained into definite statements
without actually memorizing the text, (3) as a means of securing
from the student a reproduction of the information in his own words.</p>

<p>A careful following of the questions by the reader will insure full
acquaintance with every part of the text, avoiding the accidental omission
of what might be of value. These primers are so condensed that
nothing should be omitted.</p>

<p>In teaching from these books it is very important that these questions
and such others as may occur to the teacher should be made the
basis of frequent written work, and of final examinations.</p>

<p>The importance of written work cannot be overstated. It not only
assures knowledge of material, but the power to express that knowledge
correctly and in good form.</p>

<p>If this written work can be submitted to the teacher in printed form
it will be doubly useful.</p>

the printers of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen,
and apprentices&mdash;with a comprehensive series of handy and
inexpensive compendiums of reliable, up-to-date information upon
the various branches and specialties of the printing craft, all
arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5&times;8 inches.
Their general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has
been, as far as practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief
synopsis of the particular contents and other chief features of each
volume will be found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to
embody in each publication as completely as possible all the
rudimentary information and essential facts necessary to an understanding
of the subject. Care has been taken to make all statements
accurate and clear, with the purpose of bringing essential
information within the understanding of beginners in the different
fields of study. Wherever practicable, simple and well-defined
drawings and illustrations have been used to assist in giving
additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible
help for use in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each
title is accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering
essential items of the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical
terms belonging to the subject or department treated is also
added to many of the books.</p>

<p>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of
America.</p>

<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENT" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENT"></a>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the
splendid co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals
engaged in the printing business and its allied industries
in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America, under whose auspices the books have been prepared and
published, acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance
rendered by the many authors, printers, and others identified
with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright
pages of those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless
felt that a group list of co-operating firms would be of
interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who
have co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed
(which the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list
will be printed in each volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to
the many subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its
publication.</p>
